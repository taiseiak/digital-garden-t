# We don't feel until we see

#psychology

A trend I saw in [Poverty, by America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty,_by_America) and [Atomic Habits: Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) is that people don't feel emotion for things they don't see. We don't feel strongly about the food we eat until we see the effects from it. We may "see" things by reading books or articles, or browsing social media, but nothing brings our emotions to the forefront more than immediate feedback ([[Rewarding myself for good actions\|Rewarding myself for good actions]]).

If we want ourselves to act better for ourselves and the larger society, we need to see the current state of ourselves and the world, and the change that our actions bring immediately. Seeing can be through books, games, and other forms of media, but the strongest feeling is experience. But we can't experience poverty if we aren't in poverty, so the best we can do is to read stories. Then we need to see the change that our actions bring to fighting a cause immediately. This is hard for things that can't immediately bring feedback, so we might need to do this artificially. But unless we do, we won't get ourselves to do healthy things for ourselves and others.
