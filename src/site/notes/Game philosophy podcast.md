# Game philosophy podcast

#idea #podcast #game 

While running I daydreamed about a podcast idea. At my work I created a company only podcast where I talk about thoughts I have about work. This podcast is pretty popular. I enjoy the process of creating a script and talking too. Though making the podcast I learned that I liked writing, so I started this digital garden. Though I wont expand the scope of this digital garden ([[Small actions build habits\|Small actions build habits]]), I want to log the idea I had about game philosophy.

Getting feedback on work is so fun ([[Valve's Secret Weapon\|Valve's Secret Weapon]]). I consistently do it at work and talking to friends. My favorite feedback I have gotten in my life is from Fall Queen ([[Minute long games\|Minute long games]]). Having my friends play the game and give feedback was great; I enjoyed the feedback from other participants of the gamejam too. Getting feedback keeps us grounded—it's so easy to imagine ideas without testing them. This is something that I want game podcasts to do. I want game podcasts to see what it feels like to make games. This is something that [GMTK did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8bqjpq0MIw&list=PLc38fcMFcV_uH3OK4sTa4bf-UXGk2NW2n), and they have done an amazing job. I want to do this too.

As I said in [[Minute long games\|Minute long games]], I want to get back to creating games. There is a part of me that is scared to start ([[Scared of playing competitively\|Scared of playing competitively]]), and I don't want to push the scope of my habits ([[Small actions build habits\|Small actions build habits]]). So I will give a test run in my company podcast. Podcasts usually have a 番外編 (non official episode) where they can talk about whatever they want. I'll create a 番外編 for my company podcast that talks about games, so I can get feedback on what I am creating.

One system I want to create is how to get feedback. Great games find feedback in different ways ([How Nintendo Designed Ultrahand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvOqTunOQB8), [Valve's "Secret Weapon"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Yomqk0C6kE), [Why Subnautica Owes Its Success to This Button](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVnOcmiEdIE)). I want to give a shot at creating a system to gather feedback. I know I'll have to do this at work anyway, so it makes sense to try in video game making too.
