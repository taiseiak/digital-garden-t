# Getting destroyed on Split in Valorant

#game #valorant

Some maps are easier to understand than others. I had a really hard time understanding what to do on Split, so I got destroyed. I watched a video and understood that some areas are much more important than others on the map.

For example, on Split the middle of the map is super important as there is so much high ground that you can cover with the map. If you plant in the open, you are able to see those areas through the high points. That's why Gekko might be a good agent to play on the mapâ€”we are able to plant on open areas more safely than other agents.
