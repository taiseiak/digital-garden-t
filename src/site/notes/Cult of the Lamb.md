# Cult of the Lamb

#game #game-review #review

Cult of the Lamb is incredibly polished. There must have been so much play testing, as I didn't encounter much rough edges in gameplay or visuals. I love the haunting soundtrack in the dungeons, and the cute but disturbing look that the characters have.

I thought about this game before I went to sleep or waking up a couple of times. I was addicted to parts of these games. But it never hooked me like my favorite games I played, and it didn't make me uncomfortable or awed like the genre pushing games. Cult of the Lamb was far from junk food, but not a Michelin star meal. I don't think the developers were looking to create a game like that though. I think they accomplished making a game they wanted to create.

I don't have many critiques for this game. Any changes that I would suggest are more about making the game more to my tastes, which I don't know if I would want that. I imagine this game being someone's favorite game for years, and I think it is by seeing the merch and the community behind this game on Steam. This game is like [[Portal 2 spoiler review\|Portal 2]] with it's polish and gameplay smoothness. But the game overall didn't hit the boxes for what includes a game in my top 10 list.

I am incredibly glad I played this game, and I enjoyed almost every second of it. I can feel that this game didn't make enough impressions to stay in my memories for long, but that's just the game not catering to my tastes. I can recommend this game to anyone.
