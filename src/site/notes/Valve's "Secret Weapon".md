# Valve's "Secret Weapon"

#game #video 

[Valve's "Secret Weapon"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Yomqk0C6kE) is one of my favorite videos. GMTK, one of my favorite YouTube channels, created a video about how Valve religiously uses play testing to make their games better. I felt the success of this design process when playing the Portal series.

Portal is the "smoothest" game I have played. Puzzle games often make me unmotivated because I have to slow down to think to solve levels. This kills momentum. I am not moving my character forward in the game when I am thinking. Staying still makes me feel like I am not progressing in the game, so the whole game feels like I am inching forward. Go, stop, think. Go, stop think. Other games don't have this problem, so they are more exciting. But Portal is different.

There are times when I stop to think in Portal. But they never got too long where I got frustrated, and when I usually found the solution, it felt like it was my fault for not thinking openly enough, rather than bad game design. I think Valve was able to create levels like these because they play tested so much. They created levels and got feedback often ([[It's good to fail\|It's good to fail]], [[Quantity over quality\|Quantity over quality]]) to create better levels. They did this way earlier than other developers think they can.

I changed Coten to use this tactic ([[Understanding Strategy vs Tactics\|Understanding Strategy vs Tactics]]) of play testing often when developing our product. In our case, the name was user tests, but it was the same concept. And many concepts in the video are being integrated into Coten, like not taking too much feedback directly from users, or testing super early.

Please watch the video, I really love it.
