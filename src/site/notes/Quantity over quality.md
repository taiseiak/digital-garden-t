# Quantity over quality

#habits #creating

Jerry Uelsmann split his photography class into two groups. One group would be graded on how many photos they took, and the other on the quality of one photo. The group who worked for quantity ended up with much better photos at the end the course. (Source: [Why Aiming for Perfection Wonâ€™t Help You Achieve Your Goals](https://jamesclear.com/repetitions)).

Working for quantity lets us do two things. One is getting feedback quickly and often. We can give feedback to ourselves by analyzing the work we have done so far. We can show our work to others to get feedback too. We can't get feedback as often if we are looking to create something of high quality, because stop ourselves from actually making something. We have to think, and work with caution, making us work slowly, because we can't make a bad thing if we are trying to aim for high quality ([[It's good to fail\|It's good to fail]]). 

Like many things in life, it's paradoxical that making a bunch of low quality, bad things will likely lead to making a good, high quality thing. Though there needs to be a process of analysis and feedback ([[Valve's "Secret Weapon"\|Valve's "Secret Weapon"]]), we can't get to that place unless we create a ton of bad things.
