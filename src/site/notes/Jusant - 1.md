# Jusant - 1

#game #game-impression #impression 

I picked up Jusant as I was stressed out. I wanted a game to occupy that space between being calm enough to be relaxing, and engaging enough to make me stop thinking. I liked the visuals for Jusant, so I bought it.

This game makes me want to use Unreal Engine for the next game I create. It looks so nice, with the low poly visuals. I know I can't pull that off by myself in a span of a game jam. But it inspires me. The animations are simple and great too.

I am not great at taking in environmental story telling, which Jusant uses. I don't think too much about it, as I am not detail oriented enough. That's fine though. Maybe I will watch a video on it someday, or take this as a chance to grow my skill of understanding my environment.
