# Slay the Spire is amazing

#game #game-impression #impression 

I started playing Slay the Spire again and it's incredible how well made that game is. Time melts like butter when playing that game. The difficulty is perfectâ€”I win, until I lose, but I have fun all the time. I am not a big fan of the art style, but it works. It works well enough to be one of my favorite games.

I want to know how the game is balanced. I feel that the game's analysis could be used to create some great game jam games. I just need to try it out ([[Quantity over quality\|Quantity over quality]]).
