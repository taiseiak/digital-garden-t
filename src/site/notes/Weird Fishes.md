# Weird Fishes

#music #review 

After listening to Dissect's analysis of Weird Fishes / Arpeggi by Radiohead on In Rainbows, I felt a need to talk about this song. I have interpreted the song as a story about building up, breaking down, and building up again. This is what happens in the instrumentation. The lyrics also mirror the instrumentation in this case. I found the song beautifully lives up to this interpretation. It's what I need for myself I think.

I am haunted by so many ghosts. The need to be productive pushes me down so I can't get things done, and my depression literally keep my body from moving. It all sucks. I think what I need to do is break down parts of myself so I can build up a new, more resilient version of me that I like. This process is scary. I might need to throw away things that are important and dear to me, if they are the things that are creating the demons in me. This happens in the song.

I don't feel like writing down an analysis of the song ([[Keep things easy\|Keep things easy]]). An analysis of such quality that I won't be able to match is done in the Dissect podcast anyway.
