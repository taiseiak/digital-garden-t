# A truly lazy day

Today has been a truly lazy day. I couldn't do 10 pushups, and I can barely play video games. I am tired. But I still did my run ([[Rewarding myself for good actions\|Rewarding myself for good actions]]), all thanks to keeping things small ([[Small actions build habits\|Small actions build habits]]). That's why this note is so small too. I don't have the energy today, and I am not going to force myself to create this energy. I will do things tomorrow.
