# Where to find papers

I want to find papers to use for my game analysis and research.

Here are some links I found.

- [21 Legit Research Databases for Free Journal Articles in 2022 | Scribendi](https://www.scribendi.com/academy/articles/free_online_journal_and_research_databases.en.html)
- [Library Research in Psychology: Finding it Easily](https://www.apa.org/education-career/undergrad/library-research)
- [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
- [Psychology topics](https://www.apa.org/topics)
- [American Psychological Association (APA)](https://www.apa.org/)
- [Press room](https://www.apa.org/news/press)
- [APA Databases and Electronic Resources - Home - APA](https://www.apa.org/pubs/databases)
- [Nature](https://www.nature.com/)

I haven't used them yet, but I'll write when I do.
