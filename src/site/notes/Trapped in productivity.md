# Trapped in productivity

#mentality #productivity 

I feel trapped by productivity.

This doesn't mean that I am productive. Far from, actually. I am pretty unproductive, at least in terms of how much I output. For a while I have been saying I want to create podcasts and games, but I haven't done both ([[Build identity through habits\|Build identity through habits]]). I berate myself for not creating. It sucks, because I know I'm on the [Hedonic treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill).

The hedonic treadmill is the tendency for people to quickly return to a stable state of happiness after either positive or negative events. This works well for us when we have negative things happen to us. We aren't tied down by negative events forever. However, this works for positive events too. This is where I feel I struggle. A recent example is my ending of my YouTube addiction.

I have barely watched YouTube for a month now. It may not seem like much, but this is a goal I have wanted to achieve for years now. But honestly, I've gotten used to it. The happiness I got from kicking this addiction is gone. What's replaced it is the feeling that I am "not productive enough". I play video games and do a little bit of work. That's it. That isn't enough for meâ€”or at least that's what my inner voice is saying. But if the hedonic treadmill is true, then I will never be "productive" enough to be happy.

Even if I can be more creative and output more, there will be tasks I haven't accomplished. These tasks will tie me down as much as the tasks that are tying me right now. There's no escape, other than from myself. I need to accept that it's okay to have fun in life ([[Not changing past notes\|Not changing past notes]]). It sounds weird, but I haven't. It's hard to do. There's so much pressure to be productive in this society.

I'm gonna try anyway. I'm gonna try to be chill in my life.
