# Combination balance in Slay the Spire

#game #game-analysis #analysis 

I have played other games with combinations, but none do it better than Slay the Spire. How does Slay the Spire get it so right?

What does getting combinations right mean? I think it's the end state, and the journey to get there. The best decks at the end of Slay the Spire are the ones that have a plan and execute that well. The decks that don't feel good are the ones with an identity crisis. The decks don't have a direction that they move towards, making it feel clunky. This doesn't mean that the choice of cards to play aren't obviousâ€”in fact, clunky decks often have great cards that have to be played or it doesn't work at all. But the great decks, the ones with great combinations, are the ones that let me have expression in what cards to play and make me powerful.

To make a great combination deck, there have to be cards that play well together. But cards are an aspect of deck building that the player has some control over. Potions don't do much in defining a deck; they are used to hold over until the deck gets powerful. The first important component of a great deck are the relics. They provide powerful effects that often turn normal cards to amazing cards that feel great to play. The relic that adds 4 damage to 0 cost attack cards make shiv builds possible and really fun. The relic that makes cards cost 0 after a power card is played was key to spamming power cards. The relics are, unfortunately, one of the only aspects of Slay the Spire that the player doesn't have control over the random outcomes. But you get so many of them, it often doesn't matter. In some cases, the uncontrollable aspect of relics makes deck building more fun.

Relics make the player make tough decisions on what cards to pick. If you have a relic that improves poison cards, then poison cards are much better to pick. But if this was in the middle of the run, where pivoting to another deck archetype is hard, should you take those poison cards still? Are you able to run a hybrid deck, or is it better to just keep on going with the plan you have had so far? These types of decisions break the hard combinations built into the cards. In physical trading card games, so many cards are useless unless there are other cards that are built to work along it. In Slay the Spire, this doesn't happen as much because of the relic system.

Where did the developers get the idea of the relic system? I'll look into that tomorrow.
