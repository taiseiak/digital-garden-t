# My first lazy day

#habits #creating 

Today is my first lazy day since I have read [[Atomic Habits\|Atomic Habits]]. I didn't really want to work out in the morning. But I also have been looking forward to this day, so that I can do a minimal amount of work to complete my habit. I did a small workout, I stretched, and I got the reward of coffee afterwards. I can see how making the habit as small as possible makes it easy to actually keep on doing the habit.

I will go on a run soon, and it'll be a short run. Two minutes, max. I might go on for longer if the book is interesting, but I don't really need to. Days like today are my easy days. That doesn't mean I stop [[Rewarding myself for good actions\|Rewarding myself for good actions]] since doing the action is how I [[Build identity through habits\|Build identity through habits]].

This note is short for this reason too. I [[Keep things easy\|Keep things easy]] so that I can continue with them on days I am lazy, and I can achieve great things on days that I feel great.
