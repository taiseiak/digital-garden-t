# Poverty, by America

#book #book-review #review

I bought this book on Apple Books as an audiobook. I thought the book was important enough to buy a written version on Kindle. It reminded me of [A People's History of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_People%27s_History_of_the_United_States) in the way that it showed me a different way of seeing daily life.

This book made me want to take the ideas in the book and make small snippets of analysis. I think I will do that sometime.

Please read this book. Even if you don't agree with all the ideas that are said in the book, it's short and easy to read. It'll challenge your thoughts, whether you are conservative or liberal.
