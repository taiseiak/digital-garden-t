# Understanding Valorant a little bit

#game #game-impression 

I am level 6 or so in Valorant and I finally understood some parts of the game.

In games like Dota, it's easier to gather information on what the other team is doing. If you put down wards and check the minimap you can usually tell where the other team is. If the other team is missing from the map, that usually means it's time for you to hide as they are out to get you. This doesn't work in Valorant as well.

Because Valorant is a first person shooter, there is little information that you can gather for the team. The only true way to know where the other team is is by looking. Sight lines and gathering information is super important. With information, you can move around the map with purpose and try to get kills or objectives.

When I played a character that puts smokes down on the map. This made me aware of where the team is and what sight lines we have. It made me carry the team for like the first couple of rounds. It's not because of my aim. It's because of my positioning.

Like in most games, concepts are actually pretty simple. What's hard is thinking about them and executing them on the fly.
