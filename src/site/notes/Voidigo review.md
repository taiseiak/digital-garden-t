# Voidigo Review

#game #game-review #review 

[Voidigo](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1304680/Voidigo/) does so many things right that lean into the best parts of roguelikes. I used so many weapons that made me want to see not only the effect, but the animation and sound. The emphasis the developers made on melee combat made my experience of the game more exciting than other games I have played in the genre.

I found that the power-ups don't have the same excitement as the weapons do. Some of the power-ups felt like they didn't really do anything.

I beat the game using all of the characters, and was able to beat the final boss. It was a pretty satisfying ending for the whole game for me.

I recommend playing Voidigo if you have had any fun playing roguelikes in the past.
