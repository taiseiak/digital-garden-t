# Doing what keep me satisfied

#mentality 

After watching [[Perfect Days\|Perfect Days]] and [[Using guides in Elden Ring\|Using guides in Elden Ring]], I have felt the need to just do what keeps me satisfied ([[Keep things easy\|Keep things easy]]\). This most likely means to not care about what other people think (or in my case, what I think other people would think) and do the small things that bring happiness ([[Small actions build habits\|Small actions build habits]]).

Though actions like over drinking bring suffering in the long run, I need to learn how to not beat myself up for doing things that I want to do. Often, this means to relaxâ€”I feel ashamed of relaxing often. I feel like I am not accomplishing enough with the limited time I have left on earth, or at least of my 20s. This is the productivity demon that lives within so many of us. I can combat this if I [[Build identity through habits\|Build identity through habits]]. I can create time for relaxing, but just doing a couple of minutes of whatever I deem "productive" can silence the demon in me.

Let's see how this works out.
