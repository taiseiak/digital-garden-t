# Getting my Playdate

#game #playdate

I got a [Playdate](https://play.date/). It's a pretty cool device. I want to develop games for this thing. I have some ideas of what I want to try on the thing. One is to render 3D graphics in blender and make them into spite sheets. I think this is what some games are doing to create an awesome 3D effect.
