# Cult of the Lamb second impressions

#game #game-impression #impression 

My favorite part of [Persona 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_5) was how the game intertwines two different gameplay elements together. The dungeon crawling lets me move forward the social simulator, 

and the social simulator gives me resources to use in dungeon crawling. This keeps the game fresh to me because it feels like I am playing two games at the same time. I am glad I picked up Cult of the Lamb again as I feel the addictive quality I felt in Persona 5 again, but without the 100 hour RPG part.

The first thought I had when I woke up was "I want to play Cult of the Lamb". The game is easy enough to be relaxing, but engaging enough to be addicting with it's complimentary game elements. But what really brings the whole experience together is the art and music. The game's excellent art style of flat paper like characters and the haunting but beautiful music makes me want to explore what's more in store.

The rogue-like portion, especially the combat, is super simple. This is an excellent decision as it lets me keep the base building portion in my mind while going on the dungeon. It also keeps the game relaxing. I assume this is an intentional decision made by the developers, and I appreciate it.

I am excited to play more of Cult of the Lamb.
