# Thinking about making a B-game

#game #creating 

In Getting Over It ([[Getting Over It - 1\|Getting Over It - 1]], [[Getting over it for the first time\|Getting over it for the first time]]) Bennett Foddy mentions the game is inspired by [Sexy Hiking](https://getting-over-it.fandom.com/wiki/Sexy_Hiking), a B game made my Jazzuo.

> This game is an homage to a free game that came out in 2002, titled 'Sexy Hiking'. The author of the game was Jazzuo, a mysterious Czech designer who was known at the time as the father of B-games. B-games are rough assemblages of found objects. Designers slap them together very quickly and freely, and they're often too rough and unfriendly to gain much of a following. They're built more for the joy of building them than as polished products.
> 
> In a certain way, Sexy Hiking is the perfect embodiment of a B-game. It's built almost entirely out of found and recycled parts, and it's one of the most unusual and unfriendly games of its time. In it, your task is simply to drag yourself up a mountain with a hammer. The act of climbing, in the digital world or in real life, has certain essential properties that give the game it's flavour. No amount of forward progress is guaranteed; some cliffs are too sheer, or too slippery. And the player is constantly, unremittingly, in danger of falling and losing everything.

I enjoyed Getting Over It so much, that if B-games are like playing this game, then I want to try making one.
