# Elden Ring - 2

#game #game-impression #impression 

I didn't play too much of Elden Ring today, but I had two nice moments in the game. I am in the first castle that people usually explore in the game. I was able to get to the second grace, near the elevator in the castle. The first nice moment I had in the game was the feeling of being without any healing flasks left, and getting through an enemy that is pretty tough to beat. From Soft tries to get the player to feel on edge, when messing up once means losing so much progress. But I ran through an enemy and got to the grace, and felt safety. This was one nice moment in the game.

The other nice moment was when battling a tough enemy. There is an enemy in a room in the castle that is pretty tough to beat. We have to fight this enemy to get the key, which brings us up a ladder to the upper level. I fought this enemy about 6 times and lost. I almost won once, but messed up at the last moment. But on my last attempt, the enemy got stuck on a door. I was able to strong attack through the door and chip away at it's health. This may have been cheap, but I like experiences like this in hard games. They make me feel smart and resourceful. I was [[Finding my own solution\|Finding my own solution]].

I am excited to explore more moments like this in Elden Ring.
