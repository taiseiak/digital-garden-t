# Sifu first impressions

#game #game-impression #impression 

This is a beautiful game. I don't really understand what is going on yet with the controls. I got through the tutorial and stopped playing. This was probably the most beautiful tutorial I have seen. I love how it looks like an intro to a movie. The cuts that happen when choosing the sex of the character is awesome too.

I am nervous about going forward with the game. I have heard that this is a hard game. I could see how the game could delve into button mashing. However, I am going to take this as an opportunity to learn the game myself and figure out a strategy myself. This is a skill that people who play online video games do well. I don't think I have this skill yet, so I will figure it out in Sifu where I don't have other people screaming at me for my gameplay.
