# Slacking

#mentality #creating #psychology 

I have been slacking lately. Not taking notes because my mind has been unstable. Some days are really sad, while others are happy. The instability makes note taking hard. But it’s okay—what matters is getting back into it.

My life is relatively stable right now. There will be times where my life gets even more crazy. Let’s get used to getting back to it.
