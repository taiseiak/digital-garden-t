# Small actions build habits

After reading [[Atomic Habits\|Atomic Habits]] I have been trying to encorporate some of the ideas in that book. One idea is to have tiny requirements to build habits.

It's easy to over optimize early on in habit building when we have a bunch of enthusiasm to push us forward. But when we run out of that motivation and life gets in the way of us doing the habit, if the requirement for that habit is too big, we won't do it. We need to keep the requirements so small, and the rewards big enough ([[Rewarding myself for good actions\|Rewarding myself for good actions]]) so we are motivated to just do the habit and build our identity ([[Build identity through habits\|Build identity through habits]]).

I think I am able to continue this output on digital garden more than other times I have tried because my requirements are so small. The reward is seeing the list of articles grow, which is fun to see too.
