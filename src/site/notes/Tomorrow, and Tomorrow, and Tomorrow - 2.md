# Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow - 2

#impression #book-impression #book 

I am really enjoying this book. I wondered if the author put too many references to modern problems that didn't exist in conversation before the 2000s, like cultural appropriation, but the scene about the Kotaku interview was excellent. It read like an article that could exist, and it certainly felt like Sam would say those things. The author writes characters like they would really exist in our world, but their lives are interesting enough to read. Having relatable and emotionally realistic characters is a strength of this book.

Another aspect I found to be interesting about this book is the flashbacks and flashforwards. Usually when I see flashbacks in media, especially in Japanese media, it's for exposition or getting the reader to remember something. This book flashes back and forward in time often, and every time it does the story is engaging enough to stand on it's own. But the time leaps develop the characters more, give (interesting) exposition about the characters' personalities, and provides an avenue for where I can imagine how this current character turns into their future versions. All of this happens without the story being so complicated that I can't keep up with it in my head. I am super impressed.
