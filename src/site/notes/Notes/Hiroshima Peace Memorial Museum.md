# Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum

It’s hard to not look at the photos of the wounded in the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. To the people who study about the bomb in terms of a war between countries, like I did in my American high school, the bomb can be seen as a horrible, but somewhat logical, decision by the American military. I found it hard to think dropping the bomb had any logical sense seeing the aftermath in the museum.

Some of the entires affected me more than others. The pictures of the wounded were horrifying. The story about the N family was gut wrenching. The picture of the person with black dots scared me.

After going through the museum I felt the importance of studying the personal stories of war and other events. In the book [[Atomic Habits\|Atomic Habits]] there is an episode about how the president most likely wouldn’t have dropped the bomb if they had to kill someone with their bare hands before giving the order. Humans have a hard time imagining the effects decisions have on individuals when the consequences are so large.

But this is not to say studying events from the macro perspective is not important. Studying events from the micro, macro, and personal perspectives makes things hard to understand, but is probably the only way we stop a nuclear winter.
