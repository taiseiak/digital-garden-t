# Mosa Lina first impressions

I played [Mosa Lina](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477090/Mosa_Lina/) for about 10 minutes. I didn't really understand most of the game, but I am curious of figuring out the game and the power ups.

The tutorial was nice how I was not able to move past the game until I finished the tutorial. The only complaint I have is that the tutorial didn't mention that I could use my mouse to switch power ups and aim. I don't know if I am supposed to use my mouse, because the aiming feels pretty unnatural.

I was able to complete one level, but it felt pretty lucky. I didn't understand the power ups too much. The vaporsise power up, which brings bunch of objects together and then pins them in space, is what I used to beat that level. If I didn't have that, I wouldn't have been able to beat it.

I am curious about this game because I want to understand the power ups. But I feel like I am fumbling through the game because I don't know the power ups at all.
