# Mosa Lina second impressions

My second impressions of Mosa Lina are pretty similar to my [[Notes/Mosa Lina first impressions\|first impressions]]. I still don't fully understand how the game works, especially the part where I press replay. I don't know where I end up when I press replay, and if I am supposed to keep rolling until I get solutions that I like. I am assuming the game is made to have infinite replays and you keep on replaying until you complete every level.

The levels are split in 3 sections of 3 levels, which I don't really understand either. When I press replay it seems to go back to the first level in the 3 level section. Is that the intended behavior?

I am learning more about the power ups though. I learned that the frog can be used to eat fruits for me. I learned that the rocket can be used multiple times. I learned that mobilise is the opposite of vaporise. Upgrav is probably the best one in the game so far. I still don't understand camera.

One point in the game that helped me is the messages that the game has to help the player get into the correct mindset. This game doesn't have a immediate reward for completing things. Not having an immediate reward makes me feel like I am doing something wrong all the time. But in the pause menu I saw this message from the game.

> Learning is fun

Just having a message like this makes me want to keep playing the game, because it lets me guide how I should be thinking about the game. Maybe having this message not be in the pause menu is better, but at least I found it.
