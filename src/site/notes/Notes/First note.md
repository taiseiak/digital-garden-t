# First note

This is the first note I am publishing in my digital garden.

The digital garden is a way for me to be creative with ease. By having a place where I can output notes easily, I can share my thoughts.

The thoughts will be very short and simple. The idea is to get used to writing and publishing often. I will not focus on quality.

Whenever I play a video game, I will create a canvas or use an existing canvas to create some thoughts. Then I will publish those thoughts after I am done playing that video game.
