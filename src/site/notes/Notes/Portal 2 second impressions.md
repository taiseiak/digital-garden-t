# Portal 2 second impressions

Valve smoothed and refined Portal 2 to bring the player into the zone. This is the smoothness that I talked in the [[Notes/Portal 2 first impressions\|Portal 2 first impressions]]. Itâ€™s so impressive to make a game like this. I feel like I am part of a movie when I play this game.

## Spoiler impressions

I got to the GladOs fight and stopped there. It was interesting seeing the callbacks to Portal 1, though I have a feeling this is just part 1 of the fight and I have another half of game or so left to play.

The puzzles got easier in the latter sections, but the narrative stakes were higher. I felt like GladOs could catch up to me any time when I was tricking her without her knowing. Portal is really good at creating a sense of anxiety through gameplay and narrative. This is probably why it became one of the most famous games of all time.
