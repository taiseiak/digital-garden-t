# Sifu second impressions

#game #game-impression #impression 

I played Sifu for two hours, and I can tell I will not enjoy this game.

I can't read what the opponent is doing in Sifu enough to know what actions to take. Theres a difference between deflecting and parrying, where the latter lets us attack to stun the opponent. I couldn't tell the difference between a deflect and a parry visually by playing the tutorial, which makes me not want to play the game. Not being able to tell what is going on for a game that asks for player skill and perfection doesn't sound like a good time. This is unfortunate because Sekiro already proved games can match atmosphere and skill based gameplay in a combination that can win awards.

I loved my play through of Sekiro. I knew that, apart from attacks that have the letter Âç±, can be parried. Those special attacks that can't be parried were always easy to see and react-able with enough practice. The complexity came from understanding the opponents that I am fighting. I could retry as many times as I needed to get good enough to win. This isn't the case with Sifu.

I didn't get far enough to the game to get into the loop of dying and retrying, but I was already punished for failing in situations that I feel like I shouldn't have been punished. Why should my death counter go up when someone attacks me with an attack I have never seen? I don't even know how to react to the attack. Should I deflect or dodge (in which direction)? These questions stop me from trying to get better at the game. Bosses in Sekiro had moves that I have never seen, but I knew I could get back to learning that move without any major consequences. I could get back to that place quickly too, since respawn locations were usually right next to the boss. In Sifu this is not the case. You have to go through the whole level, which doesn't sound like a fun time.

I really wanted to like this game because I learned how fun hard games were through Sekiro. The game's visuals were incredible too, especially for being an indie game. This is the type of game that makes me want to make games because I feel like I could make something better, in my mind.
