# Portal 2 spoiler review

#game #game-review #review

*I played Portal 2 to completion once.*

*Spoilers for Portal 2.*

I was stuck in one of the later levels in Portal 2. The walls were breaking down. GLaDOS, my main antagonist in Portal 1 and the first half of Portal 2, was a potato stuck on the end of my portal gun. I was using every tool that I learned in the game so far, from levitation tubes to bouncy paint. I knew where I had to go in the puzzle, and I knew the first 2 steps or so, but I couldn't figure out the key action needed to solve it. Then the solution came to my head. That's when I knew Portal was a special game.

The solution was to put a blue portal on the wall, and an orange portal to where I wanted to go. This is the most basic use of the portal gun. It's the first thing you do when you get the blue and orange portal gun. I was far into the game. I was conditioned to look for solutions using complex tools in the environment. The most simple tool in the game that made the first couple of puzzles fun, was now being used to amaze me. I felt like this wasn't an accident; the game was designed by Valve to bring this specific emotion in the player.

Valve did other things to almost perfection in the game too. The narrative pacing of Portal 2 is just right. The character's dialogue was consistently funny. The characters, which there was basically only 3, were so engaging even through they never directly interacted with me. They were all audio logs. But these audio logs were more engaging than so many other more interactive characters I have seen in other video games. The characters pushed me forward, making me wonder what was up next. The plot was interesting too. Apature Science is filled with mystery. I had so much fun digging into what the clean white walls were hiding from me.

There were a couple of moments in Portal 2 that I got stuck on. I never looked solutions up, but I didn't feel great after I solved them because they were mostly just because I didn't notice a surface that I could put a portal on. This mostly happened in the spaces between Cave Johnson levels. There must have been a compromise made between creating an atmosphere of decay and awe, and playability. Portal does such a good job of being a smooth to play game that I wish these spaces leaned more into gameplay rather than atmosphere.

I am really glad I played the Portal series. I realized through this game how amazing Valve is as a game creation company.

The next single player games I will play are either Hifi Rush, Sifu, or a Valve game.
