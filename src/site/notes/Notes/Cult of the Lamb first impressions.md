# Cult of the Lamb first impressions

I played Cult of the Lamb for a little bit before on a plane, but gave it a proper try today. I remembered the game being okay, but not too interesting. This was definitely not the case this time. I love the visuals and the game difficulty is perfectly what I want to play right now (I previously played [[Notes/Sifu second impressions\|Sifu]] and gave up). I am excited to see where the game opens up to, because the mechanics are pretty simple right now.

To continue with the game I need to feel like [[Notes/It's good to fail\|It's good to fail]]. I tend to be a perfectionist and someone who doesn't like to see myself not be able to do things. This comes to playing games too. Though I don't feel this way as much after playing Celeste and Sekiro, I still feel bad when I fail or die in games enough to kill my motivation. This is Cult of the Lamb. This is a video game about a cute lamb that starts a cult. No need to take it so seriously.
