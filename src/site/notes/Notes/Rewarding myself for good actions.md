# Rewarding myself for good actions

As I wrote in my [[Notes/First note\|First note]], this digital garden is a place for me to share my thoughts. Sharing thoughts is an action that I want to do more often, so I have reduced the friction for writing and publishing as much as I can. There are other things that I want to do more often, like running or playing video games, and do less often, like watching YouTube. To reinforce these actions, I am taking an idea from [Atomic Habits: Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results by James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits), to **reward myself for good actions immediately**.

The idea is that humans will want to do the same action again if there was a reward that was attached to the action prior. For example, people will run slot machines repeatedly because there was a reward for pulling a lever. If there was a delayed reward instead, like seeing the result of your slot machine in a month, we would not be so addicted to gambling. There are flashing lights, huge sounds, and a chance to win big money. People found out that winning small amounts often is a better way to get people to be addicted to slot machines, so modern slot machines give rewards pretty often. I use this principal to form my running habit.

Every time I run I spin a wheel. The wheel has amounts of Yen that I give myself for buying anything that I want. By doing this I reward myself immediately for doing something that I want to do, with a little bit of random chance to make it fun.

To quit YouTube I pay 3000 yen for my partner if I watch YouTube. We can research without YouTube by using programs like ChatGPT. I only allow myself to watch YouTube if I am watching with my partner, or if there is something that I must watch for research, like how to build a PC.
