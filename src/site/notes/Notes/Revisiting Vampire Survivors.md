# Revisiting Vampire Survivors

To try and release stress without using YouTube, I have been playing different games. I ended up playing Vampire Survivors on my iPad on a whim. I knew that this game was relaxing and fun to play, but I didn't know that after getting the yellow book, the game opens up. There is so much hidden things in the game that I didn't know about.

The game gets harder too after trying to get the hidden items. One or two evolutions aren't enough to carry through the game. The early game is much harder. The game is more interesting this way.
