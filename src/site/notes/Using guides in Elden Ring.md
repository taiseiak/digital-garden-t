# Using guides in Elden Ring

#game #mentality 

I have an aversion to using guides in Elden Ring. I feel like I should be able to enjoy and get through the game without using guides. But I quickly noticed today that I have more fun using guides when I am stuck in this game. This game is so large, with so many things to do. From Soft doesn't provide many guides to get through this world; they designed this world to be uncaring about me, a tarnished. The story that I create is my struggle through this world. This is nice game design, but in practice sometimes it makes for a boring game.

I find myself not knowing where to go in the world. When this happens, I know that I can look for new areas, but sometimes I don't know where I haven't explored. I can farm to level up, but that's honestly pretty boring. I can tackle some bosses, but there is a threshold of strength that makes bosses challenging, but fair. Sometimes I am too under leveled for this. The solution to all of this is to wander around the world until I find something new. But I find that pretty boring, so I use guides.

I don't want to use guides because it feels like cheating for a game like Elden Ring. The first play through should surprise me. Exploration of new areas are actually new, and I am getting an experience of Elden Ring that I won't get any other time. But I need to accept myself and do whatever makes the game most fun for me [[Keep things easy\|Keep things easy]]. For this, it's first trying to find the comments left out in the world, but ultimately some guide on the internet.

I want to get over my aversion to guides. I should play games because I want to play games. If that means using guides, then I should use guides. It's that simple.
