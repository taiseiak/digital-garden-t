# Hifi Rush first impressions

#game #game-impression #impression 

I don't know if I like the dialogue or vibe of Hifi Rush too much. It feels like the game is trying too much. However, everything in the game has this same vibe, so it doesn't feel out of place. The main character's dialogue is pretty distracting in how 90s(?) it feels, but all the other characters go along with it. I will see how things fall into place with more characters, because I could see the characters growing on me or making me not want to play the game since it reminds me of Marvel like dialogue.

I like the combo gameplay. It is the first game since [Patapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patapon) that game me engaging gameplay while letting me practice rhythm skills. In so many action games the combos are too fast and the timing so hard to find that mashing button becomes a viable strategy. With this game, the I actually have to think about the combos, which is nice for a change.
