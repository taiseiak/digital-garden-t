# Cult of the Lamb - 3

#game #game-impression #impression 

The game is getting more complicated and harder. I have died twice when raiding. One thing that's hard for me to see is the combat on the small Steamdeck screen. Characters flash white before they attack, and when there are multiple characters getting ready to attack it's hard to see what's going on. 

The base building gameplay is getting more fun though. I love seeing my group of followers grow and being able to unlock more things to build. I don't have enough wood to build things, so building my base so I am not constrained there is fun. I think Cult of the Lamb does a great job proving enough challenge to be engaging and motivating, while being laid back enough to not pressure the player. Most people could enjoy this game.

This type of organic growth, like the number of followers or the worship points you get at the alter, is a mechanic that is always engaging. Games like [Clash of Clans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clash_of_Clans) are built on this game mechanic. I want to distill down the core parts of resource building games and see what kinds of elements are needed to make an minimal viable game using this mechanic.
