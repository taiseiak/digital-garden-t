# Finally getting into Elden Ring

#game #game-impression #impression 

I feel that I am finally getting into Elden Ring.

I want to play it every day. I realized that after having some level of Vigor the game gets much easier and the exploration more fun. I liked playing Sekrio to "get good", but Elden Ring is more for exploration and seeing cool different bosses. There aren't that many different bosses in Sekiro, though I felt like I could understand every move after I learned to defeat them. I don't really need to do that in Elden Ring, and if I start to get stuck, that just means I should explore an area that I couldn't explore before because I was too weak.
