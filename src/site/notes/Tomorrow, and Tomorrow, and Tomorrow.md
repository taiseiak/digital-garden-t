# Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow

#review #book-review #book 

I haven't read many fantasy books set in the world we live in. Harry Potter did this, but the events took place in places hidden from us, which is different from this book. The characters are in interviews on Kotaku, and play games that we play, and go to places that exist. We are supposed to understand these characters like they existed in the real world. However, there is a fantasy element, where the characters do things and say things and are things that are unrealistic. They are unrealistic to make the story interesting, and cater to the "I wish I could be this way" fantasy that readers have (though readers wouldn't want to actually be these characters, the story is too tragic). That's why I enjoyed the book when it leaned more on the realistic elements of these characters. The characters were too successful and tragic that if they acted like real people, they were super interesting. And when the book catered to the fantasy to the author or reader, where the characters acted like ideal people from 2024 in a 2000s game dev environment, it really took me out of the story.

I love the parts of the book that delve into thoughts of these characters and the compromises they have to make for the each other or each other. These characters are progressive, and when they hit walls that exited in the 90s but not in the 2020s, it's interesting how they have to react. These walls can be technical or cultural. I also like how well the book is at switching between perspectives. I empathized with so many situations these characters faced, which I usually do more in non-fiction than in fiction. The author does a great job jumping time to explain the characters' thoughts and motivations.

I don't like the parts of the book that make me feel it was written for a certain group of people in 2023. I feel like this game is not going to age well. For example, I wanted the book to delve more into the struggles and excitement of developing games, and how different it is in the 90s and the 00s and the 10s. I wanted the characters to react to these changes as they are interesting characters that are capable of doing fantastically great work. Instead, I got passages of the author listing out games that the characters put on shelves, like "Half life 2, Doom, etc". This was not interesting. It felt like it was pandering to the gaming audience because it was a gaming book. There were parts that the book did a great job showing the struggles of gender and race identity, for example, the compromise that a developer had to make on a gender of a character because of 90s culture, and how that affected their game making for the rest of the book. I didn't care for the passages that felt like the author made the characters think about gender and race like they were people in 2023. I would have liked to see more conflict between some characters who were very progressive, and others who were more inline with people in the 90s or 00s.

I would recommend this book if you want an easy read just to kill time. This book won't stick in your memory like other books.
