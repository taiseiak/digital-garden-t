# Understanding that I don't know anything about Valorant

I am starting to feel some adrenaline when playing Valorant. This is nice because it's a similar feeling that I felt when I played Dota. But today I felt something else too. I felt how bad I am at the game because I don't know what I am doing during the game.

I feel like I have some understanding of the game when I am not playing it. But that knowledge doesn't translate to my in game playing. I played like am panicking and my head is cut off. My aim sucks and I don't know where I should place my abilities. This is actually a good sign though. It means that am understanding the game enough to see that I don't understand the game.

I want to take some time to note down what I don't know, what I learned, and I what I should focus on in this note.

I played two agents today: Omen and Gekko. I like Gekko more because the character is so much easier to play. My aim is so much better when I play this agent because I am not thinking about where I should place myself and where I should place my abilities. With Gekko I use my two abilities that I can shoot out before coming out to an area, then retrieve them if the area is safe. It's pretty simple and everything that I want to do happens on my screen. When I play Omen, I have to think about placing smokes in places that helps my teammates without really seeing what they are seeing. It was my first time playing on Bind, so I didn't really know what was going on.

There are a couple of things that I did well that I should focus on. One is crosshair placement. I saw that when I was actually aiming for head shots, I was winning fights more. It feels risky to not aim for the head as there is a bigger chance of missing shots, but the disadvantage of not landing head shots and dying is too big. I tried sniping and using the Sheriff today, so I think I was doing well. Whenever I felt like I contributed to the game most is when my crosshair placement was good.

Another thing I want to focus on is playing off my teammates. I can peak and cross fire with my teammates better I think. All that comes down to is looking at the mini map. To get better game sense, I should have my eyes on the mini map at all times.
