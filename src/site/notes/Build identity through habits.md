# Build identity through habits

#habits

In [[Atomic Habits\|Atomic Habits]] a key concept is to build identity through habits. Most times, people want to create habits to reach a goal or see results. But this approach doesn't work for building habits because most times the results we see from doing habits take a long time to show.

Habits break when things get tough. We won't go on runs if it's raining, or if we have a headache, or any other excuse we think. It's easy to feel less motivated if we aren't seeing immediate results from habits ([[Rewarding myself for good actions\|Rewarding myself for good actions]]), and this is even more apparent if we are starting habits to see results. That's why we start habits to build identity.

Habits prove to us our identities. If we are healthy, then we have healthy habits. If we are creative, we output creative things ([[First note\|First note]]). We don't need to see results, because our habits are the results of our identity. The results we see from our habits are just a side effect of us building our identities.

That's why I keep everything in the digital garden short ([[Small actions build habits\|Small actions build habits]]) and easy to write so life never gets in the way.
