# Keep things easy

#habits 

One lesson I learned from [[Atomic Habits\|Atomic Habits]] is to keep anything I do for habits as easy as possible. We shouldn't over optimize when we start our habits. When we first start habits we are energized and optimistic about our habits. At this stage we can push ourselves to get results. But then the lazy days come and we don't want to do what we are trying to do ([[It's good to fail\|It's good to fail]]). We don't want to run, or journal, or create something. These days are the most important days to complete our habits ([[Build identity through habits\|Build identity through habits]]), so to help us with that we should **keep things easy**.

The habits we want to create can be distilled down to things that can be completed in two minutes. We should [[Rewarding myself for good actions\|reward ourselves for completing these tasks]] just as much as if we accomplish more than those two minutes. We are doing these tasks to [[Build identity through habits\|Build identity through habits]] rather than see an outcome, so doing small tasks on lazy days value as much, if not even more, than accomplishing a lot on energetic days.

I am excited for this lazy day.
