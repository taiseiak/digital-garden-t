# Scared of starting something new

#mentality 

Like I am [[Scared of playing competitively\|Scared of playing competitively]], I am overall just scared of starting something new. That doesn't mean that I am not interested in doing new thingsâ€”actually, I am really interested in new opportunities. I want to do new things, but sometimes it takes me a while to start because I am scared. But I just need to do it ([[Quantity over quality\|Quantity over quality]], [[Small actions build habits\|Small actions build habits]]) without the fear of consequence.

The biggest fear is finding out I am not good at the thing I am trying to do ([[Build identity through habits\|Build identity through habits]]). This is a fallacy, as I will not be able to get good at things until I do it. And I don't need to be good at things either, though there is some level of happiness from proficiency. Finding how to work with myself is probably the actual goal ([[Finding my own solution\|Finding my own solution]]).
