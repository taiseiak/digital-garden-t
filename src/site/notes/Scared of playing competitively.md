# Scared of playing competitively

#game #competition 

I am scared of playing competitive games.

I'm scared of playing because I was insulted by other players for making a bad play in [Dota 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dota_2). If you have played any competitive games online seriously, you know people say horrible things all the time. It shouldn't affect meâ€”but it did. This experience made me not want to play Dota 2 anymore, and it has stopped me from enthusiastically playing competitive online games.

I want to play [Valorant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valorant). The game looks interesting, especially the strategic aspect. I want to see if I can take what I learned from starting habits ([[Atomic Habits\|Atomic Habits]]) and my analysis attitude that I didn't have in High School, to have fun getting good at the game. But I am scared of not understanding anything and getting flamed online. I know [[It's good to fail\|It's good to fail]]. But I am pretty sensitive.

To combat this I am going to start small and just have fun. I learned how to fail forward in Sekiro and Elden Ring. I'll try to have fun with it.
