# Elden Ring - 3

#game #game-impression #impression 

Today is the day that Elden Ring started to click. I got past the boss that I couldn't get past before. I did use spirit summons (the jellyfish), but no summons from other players. Elden Ring is a fun game. Like [[Cult of the Lamb\|Cult of the Lamb]] and Persona 5, Elden Ring does a great job at having two parts in the game, one energetic and one relaxed, that feed into each other.

With [[Cult of the Lamb\|Cult of the Lamb]] the split was very explicit. There was the dungeon portion to progress the story, and the city builder to gather resources from the cult. The dungeon portion was more exciting, and the resource builder portion made you think, but was relaxing. We get to appreciate the exciting parts because we got relaxed, and we get to relax after going through an exciting dungeon. It's by going back and forth that let us appreciate each portion more. This happens in Elden Ring too, but the split is not explicit.

The split is between going hunting the main bosses, which are usually surrounded by stressful and exciting castles, and exploring the world, which is honestly pretty relaxing. The castle portions are pretty stressful if you try and not lose runes. Runes are what we use to buy items and level up, and if we die you lose all of them. The only way to get it back is to go back to the place where we died and pick up the runes, but if we die another time we permanently lose the runes. There are portions of the game where we just need to run past enemies because we don't have enough resources to defeat all of them. That's thrilling and pretty stressful. So after playing a couple of hours of that gameplay, going around on the horse and finding cool places to visit is relaxing and fun.
