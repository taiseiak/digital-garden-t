# Perfect Days

#movie #review 

This might be my favorite movie.

It hit hard for me. The way the movie made cleaning toilets, a job that people look down upon, as peaceful moved me. I have been dealing with me getting in the way of accepting myself. That acceptance is what creates peace, and I haven’t been peaceful lately. I’ve been more depressed this week than I’ve been in months. This movie showed me how peace is created in spaces that I, and society at large, deem worthless.

Though I don’t fully understand the ending, the beginning is exactly what I needed. The problems that arose in the latter half of the movie were small, but that’s why they dug deeper. The problems are like the problems that I have in my head—somewhat inconsequential, but everything for the person going through. I just wanted to go back to the peace in the beginning of the movie. I want that peace in my life.

The movie shows the somewhat boring and mundane life Hirayama lives. He cleans toilets in Tokyo. Before and after his shift, little routines bring happiness in his life, like growing plants or going out to drink. He doesn’t talk much. His silence reflects the peace he feels in the beginning of the movie. Some people around him accept and respect him for who he is, and the routines are everything in his life.

Because he works around many community toilets in Tokyo, and his life is routine and somewhat mundane, Hirayama notices things other people don’t. He’s good at people watching. His relationships with people around him are very stable, and the small interactions he has are smoothed out like pebbles in a river. He sees beauty in trees, where others don’t. It’s very beautiful.

In the latter half of the movie, his routine is disrupted by multiple events, and the peace that the routines created disappear. The consequence is pretty minor, but emotionally are devastating. I feel like this often, though for Hirayama it’s external forces and for me internal. I appreciated the movie a lot because I saw reflections of myself in the film.

I learned that small worlds create peace. I learned that the line between having and faking happiness is blurred. I learned that the path we are on is more important than the destination. I knew these things already. The movie helped me remember.
