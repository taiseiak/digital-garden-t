# Hifi Rush second impressions

#game #game-impression #impression 

I don't think I will continue with this game. I don't like the dialogue. Lines like "You sound like a video game tutorial" makes me want to stop playing. It's unfortunate since the gameplay is good, especially in combat.

I don't care for the platforming sections. I don't think they utilize the rhythm system in a way that's too fun. I like dodging the things that crush you, but the platforms are just a waiting game. The game is too busy for me to platform with confidence unlike in other games. Platforming in a 3D space is pretty hard, especially when the character is so big.
