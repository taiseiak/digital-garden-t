# Valorant - 1

#game #game-impression #competition #impression 

I tried to get of being [[Scared of playing competitively\|Scared of playing competitively]] and play a game of Valorant. It was fun, though I didn't know what was going on.

Like most games with a mini map, it was so important to look at the mini map. Seeing where teammates are, copying their motions, and just overall following them was important. On aspect that I don't understand yet is when to be aggressive and when to be hesitant. Some times I would poke my head out when I shouldn't. Sometimes I felt like I wasn't doing anything. Maybe I need a match viewer or something.

The first step though is being comfortable with hotkeys. The keyboard that I have right now just doesn't cut it. I can't hit all the keys I need to hit quickly enough. Though I liked getting used to the keyboard, I want it to be wireless and I want it to have number and function keys. Maybe it really is time to get a Nuphy keyboard.

I am glad I played and I want to reward myself for playing. Feeling scared but going forward is something that I did in [[Elden Ring - 3\|Elden Ring - 3]] and it worked out great ([[It's good to fail\|It's good to fail]]). I am too scared often for no actual reason. Failing at video games don't really mean anything. I wasn't scared of playing Dota, why should I be scared now?
