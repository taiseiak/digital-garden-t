# Mortal Sin - 1

#game #game-impression #impression 

I first got interested in [Mortal Sin](https://www.mortalsingame.com/) because of the visuals. As someone who has [made a game alone](https://taisei.itch.io/fall-queen), I am interested in how making a game's visuals stylized helps make developing the game easier. I know this can be done through use of 2D instead of 3D, or pixel art instead of high definition art, or black and white instead of the full color spectrum. But I never saw people stylizing animations to cut down on development costs in a way that I felt matched the game, [until I saw Mortal Sin](https://twitter.com/sonofslobodan/status/1713723863354548437?s=20). I wanted to learn how to copy that.

I always wondered how [The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_V:_Skyrim) could have made first person melee combat feel juicy and interactive, and not like swinging pool noodles. So when I saw a bunch of reviews raving that Moral Sin was the best first person melee game, and it was also one of the best roguelikes, I picked it up.

The game didn't make sense to me when I first played the game. I felt like I was running around mashing the attack button and the character was flailing it's sword, until I died. This is not interesting gameplay. But on my second run, with the monk class, I found out the combo system and that made the game much more interesting. Especially the [shuffle combo system](https://twitter.com/sonofslobodan/status/1723468689188757716) that lets me try out different combos to gain more points. That made the game more fun.

Though I said I got the game on it's visuals, I don't think I like them too much. I can't tell what is going on with my Steam Deck. This might be different if I played on my PC.

I will keep on playing this game until I finish a run.
