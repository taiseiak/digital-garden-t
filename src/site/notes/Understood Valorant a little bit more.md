# Understood Valorant a little bit more

#game #competition #valorant 

Yesterday I thought that I didn't understand anything about Valorant. I really felt like I didn't understand anything at all when I got destroyed on Split(?). What I learned was how important mid is in this game. In so many Valorant games I didn't know why you would take mid, especially with the bomb. But now I get it, because so many great positions exist in mid. In all the games where I contested mid, and called out for help for it, the offense was better. Defense wasn't so great because I don't think I moved fast enough.

Anyway, I am having more fun with this game.
