# Getting Over It, over 10 times

#game #speedrun

I haven't been this addicted to a game in a while. Maybe GunRounds on iOS is the only other one. I didn't think it was going to be Getting Over It.

I have completed the game in under 10 minutes. I am working on trying to get under 5. I am learning how to do the cool pogo walk motions and have more control over my hammer in the air. That is my next level up, because I am too used to positioning the hammer when I am on the ground. There are opportunities to reduce time by going to the next jump quickly.

Looking at guides online, it seems like the one tip people have is to practice. I guess that means I should get the golden pot soon, if I can.

I haven't been outputting as much because I have been playing this game. But doing speedruns of Getting Over It is very much a "gamer" thing to do.
