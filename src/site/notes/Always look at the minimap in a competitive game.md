# Always look at the minimap in a competitive game

#game #valorant #competition 

While playing Valorant I notice that I play much better if I make a constant effort to look at the minimap. In Dota this was something that I didn't do well. The information you get from looking at what's on the map and what's not on the map is immense. I don't know when I should go out and fight sometimes, but I know the best time is with teammates (especially if they used a skill). That can only happen well while looking at the minimap.

I think that's the next skill that I want to practice. I just want to get used to looking at the ÃŸminimap, and aiming at the head. If that happens, I should be able to just play better.
