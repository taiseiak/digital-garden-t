# Delayed intuition

I learned about delayed intuition in [Build](https://www.buildc.com/the-book) by Tony Fadell. Delayed intuition is the decisions we make with our gut feelings, but take a long time of research and consulting before that decision. This concept was created by Daniel Kahneman.

If I feel strongly about something, I want to do something about it quickly. But often these decisions have consequences that last for years. Important decisions should be taken with care, but at some point they will fall to emotion. It's okay for this to happen if we accept that these decisions should be made with delayed intuition.

Apparently this concept is further explored in [Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow).
