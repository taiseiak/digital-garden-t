# Poverty, by America - 2

#impression #book-impression #book 

Though this book doesn't provide enough solutions to small situations, and doesn't explore the feelings of the middle and upper class families that make decision that create poverty in the US, the analysis that poverty is something that is created by the decisions of the wealthy instead of something that is created magically by the capitalistic and political system. Poverty is not something that is a byproduct of how we live, but a consequence of the small decisions that people like me create.

I will further analyze this book, but I need to buy the written form. Audio books are great for getting the general idea. But I want to take a look at the sources the author uses to create their points. The sources are a great inspiration for data to use in the Coten database.
