# Poverty, by America - 2

#impression #book-impression #book 

Though this book doesn't provide enough solutions to small situations, and doesn't explore the feelings of the middle and upper class families that make decision that create poverty in the US, the analysis that poverty is something that is created by the decisions of the wealthy instead of something that is created magically by the capitalistic and political system. Poverty is not something that is a byproduct of how we live, but a consequence of the small decisions that people like me create.

I will further analyze this book, but I need to buy the written form. Audio books are great for getting the general idea. But I want to take a look at the sources the author uses to create their points. The sources are a great inspiration for data to use in the Coten database.

One common theme that I see in this book and in [[Atomic Habits\|Atomic Habits]] is that [[We don't feel until we see\|We don't feel until we see]]. People move because of emotion. Some may say they move because of logic, but that logic fuels their emotion for doing something. And it's hard for us to feel for things we don't see. We don't see the effects of bad food until years into the habit, so we don't do anything about it. But since rotten food immediately makes us feel bad, we will avoid eating it. Poverty is the same story. We don't see the effects of buying houses, or voting for tax cuts, or moving to neighborhoods, that affect poverty. So we don't do anything about it.
