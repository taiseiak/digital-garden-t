# Getting over it for the first time

#game #game-review #review

I just beat Getting Over It.

I am so happy that I did. After I got past the orange part, where I took it super slowly, I was able to get through the game. I learned that, in the orange portion and the snow portion, you just have to take things super slowly. I breathed a lot to calm myself, but I did it. I am so glad.

This game taught me a lot, but it also showed my growth. To beat this game you need to know [[It's good to fail\|It's good to fail]]. I wasn't able to do this in the past. Mistakes haunted me for a long time. But life goes on. And I have to will myself to go on to complete this game. There is no other way around it. This is what Bennett Foddy wanted me to feel.

Celeste was the first game that taught me it's okay to fail. I died so many times in that game, but none of those failures hurt. The game is so fast in respawning you into the level that it doesn't matter when you die. And that helped me a lot, because I enjoyed that game. It taught me how to enjoy games again.

Sekiro taught me that I can take on harder challenges. If things aren't working, then I can find another way to try and beat the boss. There is no way around beating bosses in that gameâ€”even if you have a guide, you still need the skills. But I did it, and by the end I was having a lot of fun. I will forever remember that game, even though I couldn't get through the snake part without a guide because I felt so much anxiety.

But Getting Over It feels more powerful than that. It's pure will. The game was created to be hard, in a punishing way. But I did it. And, I will say this again, I am so glad I did. I really look up to Bennett Foddy, but I feel like I can say that more since I have completed the game. All I was thinking about by the end was going up. Taking my time. Enjoying the moment. And when gravity gave way, I felt so great. I feel so great right now, that high hasn't stopped!

If possible, I recommend completing this game. Take your time, but do it.

And I will do it again. I want to see how others climb up faster, and try it myself.
