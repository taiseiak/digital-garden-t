# Getting Over It - 1

#game #game-impression #impression 

I played [Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Over_It_with_Bennett_Foddy) on my MacBook pro trackpad and got to the orange. Frustration made me quit for a while, but now I am back to playing. Since then I have built a gaming computer which let me play this game with a mouse. I am still stuck a little past the orange portion, but I am optimistic I can get past this ([[It's good to fail\|It's good to fail]]).

The best way to move forward in this game is to accept that we will fall ([[It's good to fail\|It's good to fail]]). Bennett Foddy wants us to think this way (it's pretty obvious with the quotes said during the game), but it's hard to accept it while playing. But like [[Not changing past notes\|Not changing past notes]], all we can do is move forward. It's like how accepting losing runes in [[Elden Ring - 3\|Elden Ring]] is the best way to move forward. All we have to do is keep playing.

One interesting point I learned while reading the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Over_It_with_Bennett_Foddy) is that the character represents Diogenes. I forgot that he lived in a jar. But it's interesting that one of the teams in my company is called Diogenes. Why are there so many Diogenes references around me? I should know more about this person.
