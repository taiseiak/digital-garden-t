# Elden Ring - 1

#game #game-impression #impression 

I played Elden Ring for about 12 hours or so last year. I couldn't get into the game last time because I didn't understand that I needed to grind and I should level Vigor. If I knew these two things, then it would have helped me actually like the game. But this time it's different because I know these two things, and for two other reasons.

One reason is that I have beat [Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sekiro:_Shadows_Die_Twice). This game taught me so much about completing games and understanding them. Sekiro is the most hard, but fair game I have played. The game doesn't encourage exploration, as the main focus is on fighting the bosses. I like linear games like Sekiro because I don't like the feeling of wondering if I am playing the game wrong. From Soft has made sure the player knows what to do in Sekiro, and that's to get good at using the sword and all the skills you can use. This game gave me confidence to finish other games. I learned that [[It's good to fail\|It's good to fail]] and gaming is about [[Quantity over quality\|Quantity over quality]].

Another reason is that I am not playing on a Steam Deck. The Steam Deck is amazing and I love being able to play steam games wherever I want to. But to be honest the screen is too small for a game like Elden Ring. Elden Ring is beautiful. The game encourages players to find new things in the world and explore. A bigger screen helps with this a lot.

With the new gaming attitude that I have learned and the bigger screen that I am playing Elden Ring with, the game has been more enjoyable than before. It's not addicting like [[Cult of the Lamb first impressions\|Cult of the Lamb]] yet, but I have heard it is addicting for other people. Small games take time to get into the loop, and I have learned bigger games take that much more investment. The best way to invest in this game is to play a little bit each day ([[Small actions build habits\|Small actions build habits]]). I am not going to rush through the game. It's cool if it takes months to finish.

Today I beat the first portion of Margit, two other bosses that I didn't find in my first play through, and a whole area that had a building that walked on legs. I had to clean the legs to get it to sit, which was pretty cool. I am playing as a Samurai now, which I think I enjoy more than the class I used last time. I like sheathing the sword and pulling it out for a heavy attack.
