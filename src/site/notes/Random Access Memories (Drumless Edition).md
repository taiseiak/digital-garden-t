# Random Access Memories (Drumless Edition)

#music #review #music-review

I love [Discovery (Daft Punk album)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(Daft_Punk_album)). When I listen to timeless albums I wonder how they were able to create such an amazing thing. But when I listen to Discovery, I don't even wonder because I enjoy listening to the album so much. It's not the same story with [Random Access Memories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_Access_Memories). I don't think the album is as timeless and forward thinking as Discovery. Even though the album came out in 2013, it sounds dated. I think this is done on purpose, but it stopped me from fully loving Random Access Memories like I did with Discovery. Until I listened to the Drumless Edition.

I first listened to the drumless edition because of the album cover. Instead of the shiny helmet on a black background (which I still love), it's all white. I wondered what it was, so I clicked it. I had been listening to [Ambient music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_music) recently, so a drumless edition got me interested. We were testing different music on our new [sonos era 100 speaker](https://www.sonos.com/en/shop/era-100), and I remembered Random Access Memories being an incredibly well recorded album. I couldn't keep a smile off my face when I started listening.

So many of the songs that sounded dated to me, now sounded mysterious. Songs were mellow, making for great background music. But I could still listen closely and enjoy the incredible recording. Songs like "Within" become so emotional and mellow without the drums. There is no push of the drums, making the song so melancholy. The end of "Giorgio by Moroder" become a duet of base and what I think is a scratch table. It's like the album went from a nightclub album to something to listen before going to sleep. I love it.

Daftpunk could pull this off because the base album was so well recorded. Each layer was carefully created and can stand on it's own. I don't know if other albums could do this. I want people to try, because Persona 5 did it with "Beneath the Mask" where the drums wouldn't play on rainy days, and it's amazing. I saw on a video before that the drumless edition was more popular. Who knows how many albums would show a different side without the drums.
