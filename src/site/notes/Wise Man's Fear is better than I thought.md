# Wise Man's Fear is better than I thought

#book #impression 

Wise Man's Fear is the second book in the Kingkiller Chronicle, the first book being [[The Name of the Wind\|The Name of the Wind]]. I said before that Name of the Wind can be power fantasy like, but I find Wise Man's Fear better written. I still feel like I could put myself in Kvothe's shoes and pretend in my head that I'm like him, but in this book he is more flawed and interesting. He's not the child prodigy that he was in the first book, and he has more problems that he faces that are like the ones we face. I like the Kvothe in this book more.

I realized that some parts of the story are like Inception. This is a story, within a story, where sometimes characters tell stories. It's easy to forget that that kind of writing is hard to do. I don't think I could, at least.

All the different cultures that are created in this book are fun to read. They are more fun than Wheel of Time for me, as I couldn't get through the second book as I lost interest. There are too many characters in that book, and the characters are more bland than this series. I like the magic in this series, it's more grounded but concepts like finding the true name of things are more interesting than some complicated magic systems. I like the cultures, especially the one with hand signs for emotions. It helps so much that Kvothe is a curious and smart character that is very open to learning new things by new characters.

I like this book a lot. I think I like it more than The Name of the Wind.
