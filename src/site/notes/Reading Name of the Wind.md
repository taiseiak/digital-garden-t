# Reading Name of the Wind

#impression #book-impression #book 

[The Name of the Wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_of_the_Wind) is like a power fantasy, like [Isekai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isekai) but not trashy. It's written well, but I can tell it might be popular because the reader can put themselves in Kvothe's shoes. I felt like the genius that could do anything well. If I was in High School I would love this serious. I like it a lot, and I like how I am addicted to it. But in my mind, it's a little media like than art. But that's fine. I like that.

This book made me realize books like this one are important. Being able to enjoy songs like this while running, cooking, or doing whatever makes it easier to do those tasks. It's an actually good replacement to YouTube.
