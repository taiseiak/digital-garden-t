# Portal 2 first impressions

#game #game-impression #impression 

I played a couple of hours of Portal 2. I enjoyed Portal 1 a lot. I enjoyed completing a game that has little bumps in gameplay and no pressure of being a long game. Games like Elden Ring and other grand games make me feel like I have to invest a significant amount of time to enjoy the game like others. Being a working adult, playing small games has its own enjoyment.

The narrative in Portal 2 is awesome. GladOs has wittier and harsher dialogue. The new character is fun to carry around. Having a interesting narrative, though simple, really pushes the game forward.

The puzzles are easier to see what I need to do than Portal 1. This doesnâ€™t mean the puzzles are easier. Some puzzles are harder and more complex. The visuals are better, so I understand where I should be placing portals.
