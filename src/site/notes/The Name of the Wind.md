# The Name of the Wind

#book #book-review #review

*Spoilers*

In [[Reading Name of the Wind\|Reading Name of the Wind]] I mentioned that the book feels like it was meant to make me feel powerful and awesome, like an Isekai anime. The main character is super smart, but written in a way that lets us think we are them in the story. I mentioned that I enjoyed the book, but it wasn't an "art" book and more "media". I still agree with what I saidâ€”but I changed my mind on the tone. If I didn't like the book, or thought it was just bought the sequel before I finished reading the book.

Before getting to the review of the book, I want to note one thing I read in the prologue of the sequel. The author mentioned "beta readers". I have never head of "beta readers", but it must be something like play testers for video games ([[Valve's Secret Weapon\|Valve's Secret Weapon]]). Were books written with groups of people reading it before it was finished? I thought authors kept the book secret, only sharing for feedback to editors and close friends and family. That's pretty interesting that the process of writing books can be similar to making software, or video games, rather than paintings.

Anyway, I want to note the things that I didn't enjoy about the book before talking about the things I enjoyed about the book. I want to have a nice aftertaste in my mouth. What I didn't like about the book was how it didn't amaze me. I enjoyed the story, and was addicted, and made me want to copy a lot of things about the book, like how it's written and the story structure. But the book didn't amaze me. It's like how I enjoyed [[Cult of the Lamb\|Cult of the Lamb]], and learned to appreciate the art style and the structure of the game, but it didn't amaze me like [[Portal 2 spoiler review\|Portal 2]] or [[Addicted to Getting Over It\|Getting Over It]]. Those two games (three if you include [[[My thoughts - Portal\|Portal]]) were addicting, awesome, and really amazed me with what it could do. I had never played games like those. Sekiro was new and amazing to me too, and it was to other people. The Name of the Wind was fun to read, but it didn't show me what amazing things people could do with writing. It's like how Harry Potter showed the world what an author could do by mixing a fantasy world with the real world. There were so many series, like Percy Jackson, that were fun to read like Harry Potter. But it didn't change the world like the former. I felt like I had read stories like The Name of the Wind before.

I am not saying that all media that I consume has to be something amazing and new and mind changing. But honestly, the ones that are stick in my mind for longer than the ones that were just fun to consume. My friends said amazing things about this book, so maybe I was expecting too much.

What I didn't expect was how much modern ideas and lingo were in the book. I didn't enjoy how much modern views showed in [[Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow\|Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow]], but I really liked it in The Name of the Wind. I think it's because of how fictional and fantastical the world is compared to [[Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow\|Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow]]. I wanted people in that book to act like they were from the 90s, or if they didn't act like that, face problems of people who didn't like they were from the 90s if they were in the 90s. I don't have to worry about that in The Name of the Wind. If Kvoth is worrying about conserving energy while fighting a dragon, that's fine. Honestly, it's more than fine, as I enjoyed aspects like that. I don't consider power fantasies to be super artful, but I like reading them. I like feeling like the main character, all powerful and smart. This book was really good at that, and I think it had to do with bringing modern ideas like "energy conservation" to the magic system.

The author was also great at foreshadowing. At first I didn't like the idea of the whole book being a conversation in an inn. But when Kvoth started to foreshadow events, and they wouldn't happen for the longest time, it created anticipation. There are so many things foreshadowed that I haven't gotten to yet, even after finishing the first book. Looking forward to events in the story moves the story forward without explicitly talking about those foreshadowed events. I want to be able to write like this in presentations, or in podcasts.

Overall, the book is great. It's an addicting read. The power fantasy is close to just right; it's not trashy like the Isekai anime. The ideas touched upon in the book, like how it feels to fall into poverty and dealing with people with significant power from money, is refreshing in a fantasy book like this. I am excited to read the next book, but I am afraid I won't remember much from the book in like 2 years.
