# Habits in depression

#habits 

Some days my depression slows down my typing. My body doesn't move. I feel the energy draining from me. I feel empty. How do I keep on running or creating?

I get why [[Small actions build habits\|Small actions build habits]]. It's not for days that we feel energized. It's for days a sentence takes as much energy as a page. It's for days of overeating junk food. It's for days you get into bed before the sun goes down.

I still ran today. I still wrote this page.
