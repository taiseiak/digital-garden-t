# Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow first impressions

#impression #book-impression #book

I decided to buy [Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/58784475) because I have been running recently ([[Rewarding myself for good actions\|Rewarding myself for good actions]]) and want to have something to keep me interested while running. I am quitting watching YouTube, so audiobooks seems like a great alternative. While browing [Best Books 2022 â€” Goodreads Choice Awards](https://www.goodreads.com/choiceawards/best-books-2022) I saw that [Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/58784475) won the fiction category. I have been reading a lot of self-help and non-fiction books recently, so I wanted to have a fiction book like [Dune (novel)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)) to keep me interested.

Since I like game development I thought this book would be interesting. But the game development portion of this book is not too interesting yet (apart from the game system for Solution). I have read to chapter 1, I think. I like how believable the characters actions and thoughts are. I like stories that are grounded and realistic, so I am excited to see where the characters go when they become game developers.
