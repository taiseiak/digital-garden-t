# Poverty, by America - 1

#impression #book-impression #book 

I picked up [Poverty, by America by Matthew Desmond](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/61358638) as it was the winner of the nonfiction category on Goodreads for 2023. I enjoyed [A People's History of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_People%27s_History_of_the_United_States) (even though I only got around 60 percent through) and how it changed the way I view American history. Though I shouldn't expect books to be a certain way before I read them, I expected this book to change the way I think about poverty in America. In the first couple of chapters, it didn't disappoint.

The people living in true poverty, not the poverty that my mom talks about when comparing to richer Lake Oswego families, is so unimaginably far away from anything that I have experienced. I feel stressed out about my life, especially about finance as my dad lost his job in the 2008 financial crisis. But true poverty is not stress, it's horror. The stories in this book devistate me. I want to find out the author's thoughts on why people end up this way in America.

I don't think we get happiness by seeing people who are more unfortunate than us. But I felt more fortunate about my life already after reading some part of this book. I didn't choose the life I am living, and the people in poverty didn't either. I was lucky that I didn't have to live around murders or broken sewage. Though I don't want to generate gratitude from comparing myself to people who don't have as much support and things than me, it puts my worries into perspective.
