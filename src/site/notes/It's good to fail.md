# It's good to fail

#habits

I don't like not being able to do things. It's a motivator for me for learning and growing as a person. But there is a paradox here, since failing is a critical part, more than success, for learning and growing and being able to do things. I need to think it's good to fail.

One way failing doesn't feel as bad is if whatever I am doing is small ([[Small actions build habits\|Small actions build habits]]). Celeste and Sekiro made me realize this, as anytime I die I can get back to where I was quickly. Succeeding in small things is easier too ([[Rewarding myself for good actions\|Rewarding myself for good actions]]). Failing can be fun, especially if it's something like video games.

Anything that I don't think it's important, I am pretty okay failing. This is not the case for things I care deeply about. The difference between things I feel okay or bad failing are just my feeling towards those things. Even if I care deeply about something, I should start small, and reward myself for when I fail, because **it's good to fail**.
