# How to start my podcast

#podcast #habits 

I know I need to start small and fun for a new hobby or job ([[Small actions build habits\|Small actions build habits]]). But I don't know how to start my podcast. I already have one that I am doing within the company, but the topics are just about what I think about the company. It's low stakes, and I only need like 2 people to listen. Maybe that's what I need to do with this one too ([[It's good to fail\|It's good to fail]]).

My concept is to make a podcast talking about games, probably game design, then make a game based on the game design in the podcast. I would love to listen to a podcast like this, and I love talking about game design. It's like half of the notes in my digital garden. Combine that with actually making a game and all the stories that come from that, and that's an idea that I would talk about even if it were outside of the podcast world. And I want to find other people who are interested in this, that would also want to make the game with me. What's stopping me from doing this?

It's my usual fears ([[Scared of playing competitively\|Scared of playing competitively]]). I want to make it good, from the start. But I know it doesn't work this way ([[Quantity over quality\|Quantity over quality]]). But there is another fear, which is the burnout. Making a game, then making a script, then recording the show, then editing it is a lot of work. It's much more work than just writing something and posting it online. I have a job, and a life outside of this. Would I be able to create good content with this much work? Would I not run out of things to talk about?

I have ideas for like a couple of episodes. I shouldn't worry about failing when I haven't done it so far. I can get a mic, once I created the game and a script. I can record it, on my laptop or phone or something, and have someone listen to it. Then I can work on the audio quality and do all those extra polish things. Like in a game, the most important part of a podcast is the ideas in the script. Then the next important part is formatting those ideas that's easy to listen and engaging to the listener. Once I get there, everything else will fall into place.

I will do this. I am excited. And I will write how it goes in this digital garden.
