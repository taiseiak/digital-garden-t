# Trying Woohoojin gold guide

I found this guide: [I guarantee this routine will get you to gold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxP2y_q51IE). I really admire this person's coaching style and how they teach Valorant. I want to try and see how far I get in ranked while doing this guide for a month. Seems fun.

I have to record my practice and somehow get it from my PC to my Mac. I don't know what's the best way to transfer files from PC to Mac easily. I am assuming Google drive will be easy.
