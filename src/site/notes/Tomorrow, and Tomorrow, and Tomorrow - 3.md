# Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow - 3

#impression #book-impression #book 

I realized that this book has more fantastical elements than I thoughts. The characters act realistically, which I think is important for me to feel invested in these characters. But the characters themselves, and how tragic the backstories are or how successful they are in a short amount of time, is fantastical. There is so much boring work that a person does before creating great video games ([[Repetition over quality\|Repetition over quality]]) that the book glosses over to make the story interesting. This is the correct decision, as the story and characters are interesting.

Sadie and Sam are unrealistically too good at making video games to make such a grand game in a short amount of time. This is fine since it is a fantasy game. They both have super tragic backstories and work unrealistically fast. This is fine, but I am not used to this kind of writing since I have not read that many fiction books based on real life timelines.

The author is biased towards journalism in this book. I don't know if this is true, but the way the author writes about gaming journalism is more realistic than the stories about development or how people talk about video games. They might have changed this so non-gaming audiences can enjoy the book.
