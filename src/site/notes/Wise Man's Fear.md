# Wise Man's Fear

#review #book-review #book 

I couldn't stop reading Wise Man's Fear. The cultures and characters explored in this series are so fun to get to know. Kvothe is a more engaging and interesting character than in the first book, and the situations he gets himself into are more fantastical.

There are some parts of the book that stressed me out, so I wanted to skip them. I think most of those parts are with Denna. I skipped some parts about being with the Mayor too, but that's because of boredom and not stress. This is a better written book. There is further exploration into the systems in the world, and a deeper examination of characters. The new characters are interesting, especially in Ademre. Ademre was a highlight of the book. Seeing Kvothe learn his way through a new culture, struggling sometimes, is great.

There is a part of me that wants to read [[The Name of the Wind\|The Name of the Wind]] to appreciate it more, because I think I can more now. The world building is fun, great, deep and detailed.

I really liked the book.
