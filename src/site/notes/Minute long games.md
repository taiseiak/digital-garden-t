# Minute long games

#habits #game #creating

I have been creating games off and on for years. Last year I got significantly better. I created [Fall Queen](https://taisei.itch.io/fall-queen) and [placed well in the GMTK Game Jam 2023](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2023/rate/2156828). But my recent success with building habits ([[Rewarding myself for good actions\|Rewarding myself for good actions]], [[Small actions build habits\|Small actions build habits]]) from reading [[Atomic Habits\|Atomic Habits]] has encouraged me to think about game development a little bit differently.

The most important part about getting better at something is to do it a lot. It's the people who have fun playing games that are the best at games, because you do fun this more often. I like developing games. I especially love designing games and thinking about how players would interact with systems to have emotional responses. But I don't have the skill enough to create games quickly. I haven't had enough repetitions of creating games. But running and note taking have been fun for me recently ([[Rewarding myself for good actions\|Rewarding myself for good actions]], [[It's good to fail\|It's good to fail]]), so I want to take the same approach with game making.

The difference between (writing notes, running) and (making games) is that games are much harder to finish. Making a game is more akin to writing a script for a YouTube video, or entering a 10k. But the reason why I was able to finish fall queen was the time limit. The time limit made me think of making a game that is so small that it could be finished quickly. I can take this further. The two things I need to do is to build my identity as a game developer/creator through small actions done often ([[Build identity through habits\|Build identity through habits]]), and a goal so small I can finish the game and get feedback quickly. This is why I will make minute long games.

One of my favorite YouTube videos is [Valve's "Secret Weapon"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Yomqk0C6kE). Valve play tests often to get feedback about their game. The point that I love about this video is the lesson that we can play test way earlier than we think. Having a boring, unfinished game play tested still provides great feedback. I want to use this because getting feedback is a way for me to build community.

Realistically, I won't have anyone to actually develop games with me like in [[Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow first impressions\|Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow]]. But having community is important for motivation. That's why I will build community through feedback. My friends and the people around me can be play testers. I can show them progress and see how they do things. I think this will be fun. And to get people to play test often, I will make games that are super small, to use repetition to be a game creator ([[Build identity through habits\|Build identity through habits]]). That's why the goal is minute long games. Play testers should complete the game within a minute.
