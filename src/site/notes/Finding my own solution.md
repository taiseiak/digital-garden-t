# Finding my own solution

#mentality #game 

We are trained from a small age to remember other people's solutions. We take tests to test our knowledge, if we can fit a known solution to a known problem. Unless our personalities are aligned to be exploratory and confident, this makes us unpracticed in finding our own solutions. I found that I was not good at this when playing online multiplayer games.

Multiplayer games are about being ahead of others. Strategies and tactics that worked a month ago might not work today because everyone else has grown. To be at the top of the player base means constantly finding the best solutions to problems in the game. Since there aren't many others that are above you in this case, you have to find your own solutions. I was not able to do this in Dota 2. In fact, I really wasn't thinking when I was playing this game. I didn't win much. I was fine at taking other people's strategies and tactics, but when the game asked for a specific situation that I wasn't ready for, I couldn't explore to find my own solution to the situation.

The key to finding your own solution to problems is experimentation ([[Increase productivity/Fail to get things done\|Fail to get things done]]). No one knows what's right and what's wrong until you try ([[Valve's Secret Weapon\|Valve's Secret Weapon]]). The person who imagines a solution, then experiments ([[Quantity over quality\|Quantity over quality]]), then consistently finds success, is the one who found their solution.

I am better at thinking for myself after I practiced this with boardgames. I was doing this in work too I think, but that's not a competitive environment like multiplayer games. Games are a great place for people to learn this skill. This is what [Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau) emphasized in [Emile, or On Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emile,_or_On_Education), where "the education of children should be derived less from books and more from the child's interactions with the world, with an emphasis on developing the senses, and the ability to drawÂ [inferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference "Inference") from them" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emile,_or_On_Education#Book_II)). In our age, the world can be video games.

I was excited when I found how I lacked in this skill. Like [[Understanding Strategy vs Tactics\|Understanding Strategy vs Tactics]], it changed how I think about things. It made games more fun, and it made being with myself more fun.
