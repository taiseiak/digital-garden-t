# Vampire Survivors

*Spoilers for Vampire Survivors*

Vampire Survivors might be my favorite brain-off game. The only close contender is [Slay the Spire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slay_the_Spire), but Vampire Survivors is more brain off and more satisfying in a "dumb" way. Anyone who has played Vampire Survivors probably knows the satisfying sounds of picking up gems, the addicting rush when you get a 5 item chest, and how fun figuring out what the evolutions are. But what I didn't know in the first time I played Vampire Survivors ([[Revisiting Vampire Survivors\|Revisiting Vampire Survivors]]) is how many secrets there are in this game.

There are so many secrets in the game, that after hours of playing I still don't know how to get some of the items. I have gotten a bit bored with the game, since I have a feeling that it's going to be grinding out a bunch of different characters to figure out the secrets. The game is a great game to destress though, so I will keep in it my iPad.
